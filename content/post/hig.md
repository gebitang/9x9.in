 “幸福既不是美德，也不是快乐，既不是这一个事情，也不是那一个事情。幸福本质就是成长。我们在成长的时候，就会觉得幸福。” William Butler Yeats ( 1865-1939 爱尔兰诗人，1923年诺贝尔文学奖获得者 )

据[考证](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/what-is-happiness-fd72c3de795b)，这句话看起来是叶芝的父亲说的口牙 not W.B. Yeats, but J.B. Yeats

John Butler Yeats

"It is only when time hangs heavy on our hands that we turn to art and demand the right thing from artists and dramatists and poets and painters. Here they are, too busy with the material conditions of happiness, as yet they have not addressed themselves directly to happiness. And happiness... what is it? I say it is neither virtue nor pleasure nor this thing or that, but simply growth. We are happy when we are growing. It is the primal law of all nature and the universe,and literature and art are the cosmic movements working in the conscious mind."

(From: Page 121 of J.B. Yeats' "Letters to His Son W.B. Yeats andOthers 1869-1922" E.P. Dutton & Co., 1946)

beyond your current norm, beyond who you were yesterday, a new horizon, even if only a small one. It lies outside of your comfort zone.

There is joy in growth — in the journey, in the doing, in the becoming. 

it ebbs and flows. Growth has its hard times. Growth can be painful. Yet it’s in that pain, and in that difficulty, that we can eventually look back with pride.
